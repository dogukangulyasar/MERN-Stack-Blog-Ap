I seperated my project files into two part. 

## blog-app-backend
This folder contains the first part of my project. I will develop a ME stack in this folder. That means I will develop an API created with ExpressJS and used MongoDB.

## blog-app-frontend
This folder contains the second part of my project. I will develop RN stacj in this folder. That means I will develop frontend of my project with React & NodeJS.
